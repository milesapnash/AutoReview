Encapsulation is not broken - internal state is not revealed for the purposes of testing.
Each test is as simple as it could be, testing a single behaviour.
Test use JUnit assertion functions, not the assert keyword.
Each test should be named as a fact about the behaviour. The name should not start with “test” or
“should” or “check”. The name should not describe the test scenario, it should describe the behaviour.
The list is generic in T (can be instantiated for different element types) and a test drives this out.
